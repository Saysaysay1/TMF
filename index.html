     <h2>How did our friendship begin?</h2>
     <p>
         Our friendship began during the CITE Week in my first year when i went with ivar because I didn't have anyone with me at that time since my friends or close companions had already gone to lunch. Luckily, Ivar was there, and I asked him if he would come back in the afternoon, to which he said yes. So, we went to Robinson and visited one of our classmates, Carl. That's how our trio's bond started.
     </p>
     
     <p>
         After a few days, I had a classmate from a different section in one subject, Enzo, whom I thought was in the same section as me. I asked him why he didn't mention that was his section because I had asked in our group chat if anyone shared the same section as me to add to the group chat. From that point on, he started chatting with me, and our friendship began to blossom.
     </p>
     <p>
         Whenever there were groupings, we were always together. Brydon and I initially ended up together because of our group chat where I was active, but in person, I was quiet. Due to that, we started chatting and getting closer, even eating together. Once, during a group activity in English, I was in the same group as Jhon Dave, and we made a video at his house for our exam. This event marked the beginning of both of me coming together for group activities and growing closer.
     </p>
    <p>
        That's why we became close. And now, as a result, we have formed a strong bond, supporting each other through challenges, sharing moments of joy, and always showing mutual respect.
    </p>

     <p>After almost two years of being friends, I hope our bond continues to grow stronger with each passing day. Here's to many more years of laughter, love, and unforgettable memories together!</p>
